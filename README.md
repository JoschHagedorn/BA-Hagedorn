# BA-Hagedorn
This Repository contains the code used in the Bachelor thesis from Josch Hagedorn. It builts on the DeepFilter Repository (https://github.com/fperdigon/DeepFilter). Additional information can be found in the pdf-file.
## Reproducibility
  
### Download this git repository and run local
The firts step is to clone this repository
 
~~~
git clone https://github.com/JoschUniHD/BA-Hagedorn
~~~

Then lets prepare the dataset.

If you are using Windows open Powershell using the cd command place yourself on  inside the repository folder, then 
execute the download_data.ps1 Powershell script using the command:

~~~
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File '.\download_data.ps1'
~~~

If you are using a Unix-like system such as Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, etc open a console in the path of DeepFilter code, 
then execute the download_data.sh bash file. 

~~~
bash ./download_data.sh
~~~

The next step is to create the Conda environment using the provided environment.yml file. For this step you need the 
conda python package manage installed. In case you don't have it installed we recommend installing 
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) to avoid installing unnecessary Python 
packages. 

To create the conda environment run the following command:
~~~
conda env create -f environment.yaml
~~~

Then activate the Python environment you just created with the following command:

~~~
conda activate DeepFilter
~~~

Finally start the training and the experiments by running the command:

~~~
python Experiment_?_?_main.py
~~~

This python script will train all the models and execute the experiments. There are 7 different experiments. After each one all resulting files should be movend into a new folder before the next experiment is executed. The evaluation of the results is done in the Jupyter Notebooks.

If you have a Nvidia CUDA capable device for GPU acceleration this code will automatically use it (faster). Otherwise the 
training will be done in CPU (slower).
